##  2. Core Attrition Drivers (Key Findings)

The analysis highlighted three critical areas fueling the high turnover: Salary, Tenure, and Role.

| Driver | Metric | Finding | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Salary** | Monthly Income | **163** of 237 attritions (**69%**) fall in the **"Upto 5k"** salary bracket. | Indicates a serious issue with **compensation competitiveness** for junior roles. |
| **Tenure** | Years at Company | The highest spike in exits is at **0 Years (59 attritions)**. | Suggests failure in **onboarding, role-fit,** or initial training effectiveness for new hires. |

##  3. Data-Driven Recommendations

Based on the findings, the following actions are recommended to reduce the 16.1% attrition rate:

* **Compensation Review:** Conduct a market salary analysis for the **Laboratory Technician** and **Sales Representative** roles, specifically focusing on the **"Upto 5k"** income band, to enhance competitiveness and reduce financially motivated exits.
* **Enhance Onboarding:** Implement a structured **90-day retention program** specifically for new hires to address the dramatic turnover spike at **Year 0** and improve initial engagement.
* **Targeted Engagement:** Create specialized career development and mentorship programs for the **26-35 age group** and roles with the highest turnover (like **Research Scientists** and **Sales Executives**) to support career growth and involvement.
